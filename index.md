Hello! 

I’m an Assistant Professor of Information Systems at UBC’s Sauder School of Business. I received my Ph.D. in Information Systems and Management from Carnegie Mellon University.

My research interests are in the field of economics of information systems. I study the economic, business, and social impacts of technology and digitization. My current research projects focus on online data tracking, digital platforms, and digital word-of-mouth. I work in partnership with a few technology firms in these industries. In my work, I focus on methods that enable causal inference including field, natural, and quasi-experiments. I’m also interested in combining modern machine learning methods with causal inference techniques.

Prior to my Ph.D., I worked as a strategy and policy consultant after my M.B.A from the Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode and an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras.
